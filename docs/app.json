The algae are the primary producers meaning smaller organisms such as the zooplankton and the clams feed off of it making them the primary consumers. The primary consumers are what the secondary consumers feed off of, those being planktivores and crabs, finally making its way to piscivores, as the secondary consumers are the energy/food source for the piscivores, also categorized as the tertiary consumer of the chain; also meaning it is the food source for the apex consumer, top of the food chain, raptors.\",\"The reason fishers have a limit of the amount they can catch is because it initiates competition. Competition being brought upon these organisms causes the organisms/consumers to be limited on their food/energy source due to other predators, such as fishermen, feeding on them as well.

While it is an example of how energy is transferred throughout the ecosystem, it is not broad.\",\"If we were to say there were no fishing limits on tertiary predators, the food/energy source for the top consumers, then the entire food chain would spiral, especially the top consumers. If the tertiary consumers population got smaller and smaller, there wouldn't be enough resources for the top consumers, as there would be less organisms and more competition, making food less available.

Like natural photosynthesis, artificial photosynthesis can use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into fuel, while also absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Plants are called \"\"carbon sinks\"\" because they absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they release, helping to reduce the greenhouse effect. \nHow Plants Help Reduce Climate Change:\nCarbon Dioxide Absorption:\n.\nPlants take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, using it to create sugars and other organic compounds for growth.\nEnergy Conversion:\n.\nPlants convert light energy into chemical energy, which is stored in the form of sugars and other organic molecules.\nOxygen Release:\n.\nAs a byproduct of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen back into the atmosphere.\nLong-Term Carbon Storage:\n.\nWhen plants die, the carbon they have stored in their bodies can remain in the soil for long periods, further reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.\nReducing the Greenhouse Effect:\n.\nBy absorbing carbon dioxide and storing it in their tissues, plants help to reduce the concentration of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming. \",\"To understand how artificial photosynthesis might reduce climate change effects, we need to investigate several key aspects. These include optimizing energy efficiency, developing affordable and scalable catalysts, and ensuring the technology's durability and long-term stability. Additionally, we should explore how artificial photosynthesis can be integrated with other climate mitigation strategies and evaluate its potential impacts on ecosystems and carbon cycles. \nHere's a more detailed breakdown of the questions we should investigate:\n1. Energy Efficiency and Scalability:\nHow can we maximize the efficiency of artificial photosynthesis systems in converting solar energy into usable fuels or chemicals?\nWhat are the most promising materials and designs for light-harvesting and catalytic conversion?\nHow can we develop scalable systems that can produce significant quantities of fuel or chemicals to reduce reliance on fossil fuels? \n2. Catalyst Development:\nWhat are the most effective and cost-effective catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction or water splitting? \nHow can we ensure that these catalysts are stable and durable under various environmental conditions? \nCan we develop catalysts that are highly selective in producing specific desired products, minimizing unwanted side reactions? \n3. Scalability and Deployment:\nHow can we integrate artificial photosynthesis systems into existing energy infrastructure, such as power plants or industrial facilities? \nWhat are the potential environmental impacts of large-scale artificial photosynthesis deployments, including water usage, land requirements, and potential disruption of ecosystems? \nHow can we develop cost-effective and sustainable manufacturing processes for artificial photosynthesis devices? \n4. Integration with Other Climate Mitigation Strategies:\nHow can artificial photosynthesis be combined with other technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, to maximize its effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions? \nCan artificial photosynthesis contribute to developing sustainable and closed-loop systems for energy production and resource management? \nWhat are the potential synergies between artificial photosynthesis and other climate mitigation measures, such as reforestation and afforestation? \n5. Ecosystem Impacts and Carbon Cycles:\nHow will the large-scale deployment of artificial photosynthesis affect the global carbon cycle and the balance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere? \nWhat are the potential impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity from artificial photosynthesis, and how can these impacts be minimized? \nHow can we ensure that artificial photosynthesis contributes to a more sustainable and resilient planet, rather than exacerbating existing environmental challenges\",,C,0,\"Artificial photosynthesis could reduce climate change effects by converting CO2 into usable products like fuels, which would effectively remove carbon from the atmosphere and provide a clean energy source. Unlike natural photosynthesis in plants, where carbon is stored within the plant's biomass, artificial photosynthesis can directly convert CO2 into fuels, eliminating the need for storage in a \"\"body\"\". \nHere's a more detailed explanation:\nNatural Photosynthesis:\nPlants use sunlight, water, and CO2 to produce glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. The carbon from CO2 is incorporated into the plant's biomass, including its leaves, stems, and roots. \nArtificial Photosynthesis:\nThis is an engineered system that mimics the process of photosynthesis but doesn't rely on plants. It uses solar energy, water, and CO2 to produce fuels, chemicals, or other valuable products. \nDirect CO2 Removal:\nArtificial photosynthesis systems, like the artificial leaf, can directly convert CO2 into useful products like fuels. This means the carbon from CO2 is not stored within a \"\"body\"\" (like a plant), but rather transformed into a usable form. \nClimate Change Mitigation:\nBy removing CO2 from the atmosphere and converting it into fuels, artificial photosynthesis can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. \nExamples:\nResearch is exploring different approaches to artificial photosynthesis, including using solar cells and electrocatalysis to drive the chemical reactions that convert CO2. \nIn essence, artificial photosynthesis offers a potential solution to climate change by directly removing CO2 from the atmosphere and converting it into a usable form, unlike natural photosynthesis where the carbon is stored within plant biomass. \",\"Yes, artificial photosynthesis has the potential to be a beneficial strategy for reducing the effects of climate change. It offers a way to produce clean fuels and potentially remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, both of which are crucial for combating climate change. However, it also faces significant challenges and requires further research and development before it can be widely implemented. \nHere's why artificial photosynthesis is a promising approach:\nClean Energy Production:\n.\nArtificial photosynthesis can mimic the process of natural photosynthesis to convert sunlight into energy in the form of fuels like hydrogen. Unlike fossil fuels, these fuels would not release greenhouse gases when burned, making them a cleaner alternative. \nCarbon Dioxide Removal:\n.\nSome systems of artificial photosynthesis are designed to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while producing fuel. This could help mitigate climate change by reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nRenewable Energy Source:\n.\nArtificial photosynthesis utilizes sunlight, a renewable resource, which is abundant and readily available. This contrasts with fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to climate change. \nPotentially More Efficient than Natural Photosynthesis:\n.\nSome research suggests that artificial photosynthesis could be more efficient at converting sunlight into energy than natural photosynthesis in plants. \nHowever, artificial photosynthesis also faces challenges: \nScalability and Cost:\n.\nCurrently, artificial photosynthesis systems are still small-scale and expensive. Scaling up these systems to a larger scale would require significant investments in research and development.\nStability and Efficiency:\n.\nImproving the stability and efficiency of artificial photosynthesis systems is crucial for their widespread adoption.\nMaterial Science:\n.\nAdvancements in material science are needed to develop more robust and efficient catalysts for artificial photosynthesis.\nIn conclusion, artificial photosynthesis holds considerable promise for reducing the effects of climate change, but it's not a silver bullet solution. It requires continued research, development, and investment to overcome the current challenges and achieve its full potential\",Nothing,1,1,4,By teaching,1,1,4,1,4,4,1,4,1,4,1,1,2,3,1,,1,0,1,0,0,0,,1,0,\n130C29,130,HSBAPT11,2,2025-05-12 17:56:44.811,2025-05-12 18:20:04.445,23.33,1,2,6,1,9,0.9999999999999999,3,1,1.5339743419446938,3.363652606272306,I think people call plants carbon sinks because they take most of the carbon.

the interaction of these biological, chemical, and social factors likely shaped the trends observed in the 1950s bed bug populations.\",\"Continuous exposure to DDT would have led to the survival of those bed bugs that had genetic mutations allowing them to withstand the effects of the pesticide. As a result, the subsequent generations of bed bugs would predominantly consist of individuals that were more resistant, potentially rendering DDT less effective as a control measure.\",B,I think this because with the DDT the bed bugs in the US population will decrease.,\"Yes, it is possible for a bed bug that has developed nerve insensitivity to survive being sprayed with pyrethroids.

This mutation is the nerve insensitivity which helps some bed bugs survive so they were able to pass it down to their offspring and grow a population of bed bugs that are resistant.,\"I think their results would show an even higher percentage of bed bugs that survived DDT, because the ones that are non nerve insensitive will have died off more, leaving the nerve insensitive ones to reproduce with more that have this trait. This will make more offspring that can survive the DDT, which will cause an increase in bed bugs that survived.\",C,\"I think it stayed the same because there was no longer a pesticide that killed bed bugs will non nerve insensitivity, so both bed bugs woud have equal chances of survival.\",\"Yes because if both DDT and pyrethroids attack bed bugs in similar ways, they will react similary to both. So if the bed bug is nerve-insensitive and that is apart of a normal bed bug that would be affected, then the nerve insensitive bed bug will likey survive, or have a hgiher rate of survival.\",A,1,i'm not sure which one is genotype 1 or 2 but the nerve insentive bed bugs resistant to DDT are gentype one then they are likely not resistant to pyrethriods because they dying and decreasing in size while the other genotype is growing.

I don't understand how to finish the bar graph because there is no information.,1,1,0,1,0,1,\"In the 1950s, within the bed bug population exposed to insecticides like DDT, a key event was the development of resistance to these pesticides. This resistance occurred due to natural selection, where bed bugs with certain genetic mutations survived exposure to DDT and passed those genes on to their offspring. As a result, the bed bug population shifted towards individuals better equipped to withstand the effects of insecticides, leading to the resurgence of bed bugs after the ban on DDT in the latter half of the 20th century. \n\",\"In 1959, a second group of bed bugs tested in the same city where DDT was used would likely show even more resistance to DDT than the first group tested in the 1950s. This is because the prolonged exposure to DDT over the years has allowed the bed bugs to adapt and evolve.\n\",B,The populations of the bed bugs went up.,\"Yes, it is possible for a bed bug that has developed a nerve-insensitivity (or knockdown resistance) to DDT to also survive pyrethroid exposure. Both DDT and pyrethroids target similar sites in the nerve cells of insects, specifically the sodium pores, and mutations that offer resistance to one can often provide resistance to the other. \n\",A,1,It does not support that claim.,It was awful.

When the pesticide was applied, most of the bugs died, but the resistant ones survived and reproduced. Over time, their offspring inherited the resistance, and the bed bug population became harder to kill. \",\"If the researchers captured and tested another group of bed bugs in the same city in 1959, their results would likely show that a much larger number of bed bugs were resistant to DDT compared to earlier years. This is because DDT had been used continuously, and over time, only the bed bugs with natural resistance survived and reproduced. As a result, resistance would have become more common in the population, making DDT less effective. This is a clear example of evolution by natural selection in response to human actions.\",A,Because it kills the bed bugs.,\"Yes, it is possible that a nerve-insensitive bed bug could survive being sprayed by pyrethroids. Since both DDT and pyrethroids affect the nerves of bugs in similar ways, a bed bug that has evolved to be insensitive to the effects of these chemicals would be able to survive exposure. This resistance could happen through genetic mutations that make the bed bug's nerve cells less sensitive to the chemicals, preventing them from being paralyzed or killed. If these resistant bed bugs survive and reproduce, their offspring would inherit the resistance, leading to a population of bed bugs that is harder to control with pyrethroids.\",A,1,\"If bed bugs are insensitive to the nerve-targeting effects of pyrethroids, they would survive exposure to the pesticide. Since pyrethroids affect the nervous system in a similar way to DDT, a bed bug with nerve-insensitivity would not be paralyzed or killed by the chemical. As a result, these resistant bed bugs would survive, reproduce, and pass on the resistance to future generations, making the population more difficult to control with pyrethroids over time.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,3,1,,1,1,0,0,0,0,,0,1,\n135C10,135,HSBAPT7,3,2025-04-23 17:42:39.56245,2025-04-23

Physical activity activates the muscle pump, which is when muscles contract and relax, squeezing veins and helping move blood back toward the heart. This process supports circulation, ensuring oxygen and nutrients reach tissues efficiently. Large muscles, like those in the legs, work with smaller muscles and valves in veins to keep blood flowing, especially during movement. Studies and models show that regular exercise improves cardiovascular function, lowers blood pressure, and increases stamina.

Some new salmon species might be introduced, while some salmons might also leave to find another place to survive and reproduce. \",decrease,0,decrease,increase,1,\"The fish are more concentrated in one area, so more predators will come to prey on these salmons. \",increase,1,the salmons are all concentrated in one area so it is easier for disease to spread. ,\"I think no, because that will mean that there is more space for the salmon to live in, so the salmon population would not have decreased as much as it did before. \",B,\"This is because the only thing that hatcheries are doing is making more baby salmons survive and go into the habitat. But the amount of resources does not increase, so the baby salmons still wouldn't be able to survive in the wild anyways. \",B,1,\"There is now more resources available and the population disperses, lowering predation and disease. The salmon population will increase and then over shoot, then slowly lower down to the carrying capacity, which is higher as it was before the dams were removed. \",C,\"A combination of hatcheries and dam removal is the best approach for restoring salmon populations. Carrying capacity limits the number of salmons that can survive because of limitation of resources, predation, disease, and more. Dams limits the resources, which decreases the salmon population. Dam removal increases resources, decreases predation and disease by dispersing the population, and hatcheries makes sure that more salmon offspring can survive. The Chinook and Coho hatchers release up to 6075000 salmon offsprings every year back into the wild. These combined together will make the salmon population experience exponential growth before settling down at their carrying capacity. \",\"The removal of just 4 dams is definitely not enough to restore historical salmon population. More dams will need to be removed. Around 2000 dams were built and together they decreased the salmon population, so in order for the population to be restores, most of those dams have to be removed. \",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,3,5,,1,0,0,0,1,0,,0,0,\n124C24,124,HSBAPT23,1,2025-05-02 18:33:30.614042,2025-05-02 19:17:23.301851,43.88,2,2,6,1,16.59,,,,,,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,\"The building of the dam could disrupt the salmon's life cycle because some of the salmon arent able to reach the ocean, they are blocked off.

Hemoglobin Structure & Function:\nNormal Hemoglobin (HbA): Red blood cells contain hemoglobin (HbA), a protein with four subunits that binds and carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\nHbS Mutation: The HbS allele contains a mutation that causes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin to be abnormal (HbS).\nPolymerization: When HbS loses oxygen, it can polymerize, forming long chains of hemoglobin molecules within the red blood cell. \n2. Red Blood Cell Shape and Flexibility:\nNormal Red Blood Cells: Healthy red blood cells are flexible and disc-shaped, allowing them to easily pass through small blood vessels and deliver oxygen.\nSickled Red Blood Cells: The polymerization of HbS causes the red blood cells to distort into a rigid, sickle (crescent moon) shape.\nReduced Flexibility: Sickled red blood cells are less flexible and can get stuck in small blood vessels, blocking blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues and organs. \n3. Consequences of Sickled Cells:\nReduced Oxygen Carrying Capacity: Because sickled cells are less efficient at carrying oxygen, the overall oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced.\nAnemia: Sickled cells also have a shorter lifespan than normal red blood cells, leading to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and further reducing oxygen delivery.\nPain Crises and Organ Damage: Blockage of blood vessels by sickled cells can cause severe pain (pain crises) and damage to various organs due to oxygen deprivation. \nIn summary, the HbS allele leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin, which, upon deoxygenation, causes red blood cells to sickle. This sickling reduces the flexibility of red blood cells, impairs their ability to carry oxygen efficiently, and leads to various health problems, including anemia and organ damage.\",The claim that an objectb,\"Genetic Factors:\nSickle cell disease is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which provides instructions for making beta-globin, a subunit of hemoglobin.\nThis mutation leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S (HbS), which can distort red blood cells into a sickle shape.\nThe severity of sickle cell disease and its symptoms can vary based on the specific genetic mutations a person inherits, such as HbSS, HbSC, or HbSN2-thalassemia. \nEnvironmental Factors:\nWeather: Studies have shown that exposure to cold temperatures or high wind speeds can increase the frequency of painful episodes (vaso-occlusive crises) in individuals with sickle cell disease.\nAir Quality: Exposure to air pollutants, such as ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide, has been linked to increased hospital admissions for sickle cell disease complications.\nAltitude: Lower oxygen levels at higher altitudes can trigger sickle cell crises in individuals with sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease.\nInfections: Infections, such as malaria and bacterial infections, can exacerbate sickle cell disease symptoms and increase the risk of complications. \nConclusion:\nThe variation in symptoms for individuals with sickle cell disease appears to be a result of both genetic predispositions and environmental influences. While the genetic mutation determines the presence of the disease, environmental factors can trigger or worsen the severity of symptoms and complications. \",\"Here is what might be appreciated in a well-designed test on this topic:\n1. Clear and Specific Learning Objectives:\nThe test should clearly outline the learning objectives it assesses. For example, is the goal to understand:\nThe concept of variability in disease presentation?\nThe factors that contribute to this variability (e.g., genetics, environment, lifestyle)?\nThe importance of individualized approaches to diagnosis and treatment?\nSpecific examples of diseases where symptom variability is prominent?\nKnowing the learning objectives would help understand the purpose of the test questions. \n2. Real-World Scenarios and Case Studies:\nIncluding realistic case studies or scenarios would be beneficial. These would illustrate how the same disease can manifest differently in various individuals.\nExamples could include descriptions of patients with the same condition who present with different symptom sets, requiring different treatment plans. \n3. Variety of Question Types:\nA good test would include a range of question types to assess understanding from different angles. This might include:\nMultiple-choice questions: To test basic knowledge and comprehension.\nTrue/False questions: To assess understanding of concepts.\nMatching questions: To match symptoms to potential diseases or contributing factors.\nShort answer questions: To explain the reasons behind symptom variability.\nCase Study Questions: To apply knowledge to a specific situation. \n4. Questions That Promote Critical Thinking:\nQuestions that go beyond simple recall and require critical thinking are valuable. For example, questions that ask to:\nAnalyze the possible reasons behind differences in symptoms.\nEvaluate treatment strategies based on the specific symptoms a patient presents.\nInterpret data or medical information to draw conclusions. \n5. Inclusion of Visual Aids:\nIf appropriate, the test might include visual aids such as diagrams, charts, or infographics that could help in understanding the concepts. For example, a graphic illustrating how genetic factors might influence symptom presentation. \n6. Clear and Concise Language:\nUsing clear and concise language, avoiding overly technical terms unless properly defined, is important. \n7. Immediate Feedback or Explanation:\nReceiving immediate feedback or explanations for the correct answers after completing the test or each question would be useful. This would help learn from mistakes and improve understanding. \nOverall:\nA good test on this topic should assess understanding of the underlying reasons for variation in disease manifestation, and the ability to apply this knowledge in practical situations. It should be engaging, relevant, and promote a deeper understanding of the complexity of human health.\n\",1,4,1,By teaching,4,3,2,3,2,1,3,4,2,4,1,1,2,3,1,,1,0,1,0,0,0,,1,0,\n112D13,112,HSBAPT11,1,2025-05-12 18:54:54.095,,,2,2,6,1,,,,,,,is sickle cell genetic,Contains instructions for the hemoglobin protein,1,Carries oxygen through blood vessels to muscles,0,Attaches oxygen to red blood cells,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,2,1,,2,1,0,0,0,0,,0,1,\n130C29,130,HSBAPT11,1,2025-05-12 17:56:44.811,2025-05-12 18:20:04.445,23.33,1,2,6,1,5.82,3.1377568646188587,2.479767993729835,3.5869468489158356,2.3980769741659196,3.6363473937276947,What are the severe symptoms of someone who has sickle cell? ,Contains instructions for the hemoglobin protein,1,Attaches oxygen to red blood cells,1,Carries oxygen through blood vessels to muscles,1,they have a disease called sickle cell ,\"It does not support the claim above\n\",I think it is both environmental and gene factors.

For example, if a protein folds the wrong way, the protein's role would have changed, and it would create health effects (Prion diseases).\nRed blood cells are semi-circular, and they have the ability to store, exchange, and move gasses throughout the body. They are also very flexible, which allows them to fit into small veins and arteries easily. When you change the shape to be sickle-like, the ability for the cells to squeeze into small areas and to store oxygen are lost, for there isn't the same flexibility to provide the oxygen with space. \",\"Both genetic and environmental factors cause variation in the symptoms for people with sickle cell disease, for if a condition, which limits the respiratory system's ability to bring oxygen into the body, is present, the regular cells would not be carrying enough oxygen to sustain the body. If one had been exposed to extremely bad air, second-hand smoke, had/is smoked/smoking, then the body would have more pollutants in it, and that would prevent the lungs from working at 100%, doing the same thing as a genetic-condition.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,3,1,,1,1,1,0,0,0,,0,1,\n23939,,HSBAPT13,3,2025-06-02 20:11:25.762,2025-06-02 20:35:05.596,23.66,1,1,6,1,6.07,2.073559196880237,2.0672351491313834,2.982478887193391,1.5339743419446938,2.3636526062723053,mkgldlfkmgm,Attaches oxygen to red blood cells,0,Carries oxygen through blood vessels to muscles,0,Attaches oxygen to red blood cells,0,It duplicates,n0o0o0o0o0o,ljnkbhjgvhfcgd5,;kfjsldkfnknsd,2,2,3,\".';l,kmjnhubgyvftdreswed\",3,1,2,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n103B01,103,HSBAPT13,3,2025-06-02 17:32:47.208,2025-06-02 18:01:00.521,28.22,2,4,9,1,7.25,2.79577689728963,2.6367507857153045,2.2089359234448884,3.0679486838893877,2.6363473937276947,just keep asking for questions,Attaches oxygen to red blood cells,0,Carries oxygen through blood vessels to muscles,0,Contains instructions for the hemoglobin protein,0,older pepole,it could harm people badly,its both,they talked about the humans blood cells,3,3,2,the questions were a bit harder then normal,3,2,3,1,3,3,2,4,2,3,3,1,1,3,2,,1,0,1,1,1,1,,0,0,Patterns Science\n125C09,125,HSBAPT13,3,2025-05-30 17:43:00.89,2025-05-30 17:45:19.554,2.31,1,1,6,1,0.59,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,yes,yes,ye,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,3,1,,1,1,0,0,1,1,Pre-AP Biology is a framework curricula composed of both provided and teacher-designed (and district aligned) lessons.,0,0,Pre-AP Biology; Mc-Graw Hill Biology; Science Education Partnership (Hutch Cancer Center)\n125C12,125,HSBAPT13,3,2025-05-30 17:41:59.356,2025-05-30 18:22:01.083,40.03,1,2,7,1,10.28,0.9999999999999999,1,1,1,2.0909578188169164,people are different,Carries oxygen through blood vessels to muscles,0,Attaches oxygen to red blood cells,1,Contains instructions for the hemoglobin protein,0,they are wired differently ,mis amigas y yo vomos a la playa contigo ,como se dice feet en espanol,my teacher is really mean to my and wont help me in class ,1,1,4,the question are really hard,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,,1,1,0,0,1,1,Pre-AP Biology is a framework curricula composed of both provided and teacher-designed (and district aligned) lessons.,0,0,Pre-AP Biology; Mc-Graw Hill Biology; Science Education Partnership (Hutch Cancer Center)\n127B49,127,HSBAPT13,3,2025-05-30 15:39:35.57,2025-05-30 16:19:11.295,39.6,1,1,6,1,10.17,3.6880595902006457,4,3.017521112806609,4,4,This is because they are affected more than other people are.,Contains instructions for the hemoglobin protein,1,Carries oxygen through blood vessels to muscles,0,Attaches oxygen to red blood cells,0,they get sickle cell disease because it is a recessive gene.,Yes this is true because the sickle cell red blood cells can't get through the blood vessels.,when the amount of wind increases there is more pollution which causes people to go to the hospital more often with pain from the sickle cell disease.,I Liked the real would examples that they gave us.,4,1,4,No I thought that is was pretty straight forward.,4,4,4,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,3,3,,1,1,0,0,0,0,,1,1,College Board Pre-AP Biology\n580088,,HSBAPT13,3,2025-05-30 14:42:17.971,2025-05-30 15:20:46.9,38.48,1,2,6,1,9.88,1.9999999999999998,2,2,2,2.3636526062723053,\"What their blood type is, figure out their white blood count, do they have any history of low blood count or anything like that\",Attaches oxygen to red blood cells,0,Carries oxygen through blood vessels to muscles,0,Contains instructions for the hemoglobin protein,0,It can cause to many sickle cells to appear and make the blood system disfunctionate,\"Yes, and objects structure can impact function.

Data include the graph above, which shows that the amount of thalidomide and amount of transcription factors have a inverse relationship, as while thalidomide amounts increase, transcription factors decrease, which could lead to many mutations in producing genes or disorders such as phocomelia, especially during development of babies. The collective evidence of all of this research has concluded that thalidomide is one of the main or a contributing reason to the shortened or missing limb phenotype in babies.\",I enjoyed the some simpler questions that didn't require long answers.,4,2,3,Ask very specific instructions in questions in order to engage comprehension.,3,3,2,3,1,3,4,1,3,2,2,1,1,3,3,,1,1,0,0,0,0,,1,1,College Board Pre-AP Biology\n127B12,127,HSBAPT17,1,2025-05-30 15:40:42.199,2025-05-30 16:57:50.174,,1,2,6,1,,1.755917576321797,2.6367507857153045,2.8085851893617204,3.0000000000000004,2.6363473937276947,Do you know if you have a genetic mutation in your DNA or do you have any family members with a genetic mutation in their DNA?,\"Thalidomide could cause limbs to develop differently because since it wasn't approved for pregnant women, it could affect the baby from growing correctly in the womb.\",just before,1,does,1,\"If the thalidomide was taking away the transcription factors, does that mean that the genes weren't fully developing which caused the increase in babies born with shortened or missing limbs?\",\"I believe that thalidomide was the cause of shortened or missing limb phenotype in babies because based on the data in questions three and five, both the babies and the mice had shortened limbs when they took the medicine.\",I like that there are some written answers and some multiple choice answers.

This is because during this period, natural selection took its course and as more Tomcod were born, some had a trait that allowed them to not have liver tumors resulting from the PCB. These Tomcod survived more frequently and thus were able to pass on the trait of not getting liver tumors to their children, unlike the Tomcod who did get liver tumors.

We know that all of the eggs from the different fish were exposed to high levels of PCBs, which, if we believed that the clean-up project took away their tumors, would mean that all of the fish would have high dead egg rates.  However, we observe that the eggs from the Hudson river survive. This is because they adapted through natural selection to be resitant to PCBs, supporting my earlier claim.\",A,B,0,\"I  think that the amount of liver tumors in the Hudson River Tomcod decreased over time, from the 1980s to today, because natural selection occurred, which allowed a gene that resisted PCBs to become more prevalent, allowing liver tumors to decrease. What happened was that once the Hudson River Tomcod were exposed to high levels of PCBs, the trait for resistance against PCBs finally mattered. There might have been some who had been resistant, but that didn't affect Tomcod survival, and therefore wasn't passed down any more or less than the trait of not having resistance to PCBs. As the table says,  \"\"The frequency of liver tumors in Hudson River tomcod decreased over time between 1983 and 2015.\"\" This means something had to have happened for the rate to decrease. Although the cleanup project occurred, after testing eggs from the Hudson River, which had been exposed to high amounts of PCBs for a long time, and eggs from nearby rivers which had been exposed way less than the Hudson River to PCBs, it is seen that \"\"Most of the tomcod eggs from the Hudson River survived, some of the eggs from the Shinnecock Bay survived, and very few of the eggs from the Miramichi River survived being exposed to PCBs.\"\" This means that although the clean-up project decreased the amount of PCBs in the Hudson River, the fish adapted and \"\"almost all of the Hudson River tomcod had the PCB resistance trait\"\" because they had adapted to an environmental change that threatened their survival.\",\"The test on the previous page made me feel like I was discovering more about the situation as we went along.

This is because you can already see a drastic (and the majority of) decrease in tomcod liver tumors (1997 and 2001 graph), which happened even before the project began. \",B,\"Extra information, such as the levels of PCB in the river all throughout these years would also help.\",\"The tomcods in places with high levels of PCB had a much higher survival rate after being exposed to high levels of PCB, while tomcodes in areas with much lower PCB had a lower rate of survival after being exposed to high levels of PCB.\",A,\"This data supports my initial explanation, because natural selection of tomcods with higher resistance levels towards PCB is clearly shown through the environmental difference. The Tomcods that lived in extreme levels of PCB were pushed so that only the fish with resistance survived, thus passing on that trait to their offspring. On the other hand, the Tomcods that lived in low levels of PCB did not have to go through that natural selection, thus leaving them with low resistance to PCB (because it was not needed for their survival in that specific environment).\",A,C,1,\"I think the amount of liver tumors in Hudson River tomcod decreased over time through natural selection. Going back to the 1980s, a lot of PCBs were being dumped into the Hudson River, where they negatively impacted the tomcod there, leading many fish to develop liver tumors and die. Yet, a small fraction of them survived due to a genetic variation in their allele, which allowed for resistance against the PCB in the water. In so, because more of these fish survived, they were able to live long enough to pass that allele on to their offspring, of which, after many generations, developed a population which consisted mostly of resistant PCB tomcod, as seen through the evidence presented above. This resistance and survival can be seen firsthand in the survival rate of tomcod eggs experiment, comparing the tomcods that were exposed to high levels of PCBs for many decades with ones that were only exposed to low levels (the result was a mass death for other tomcods, while a majority of Hudson River tomcods survived).\",\"I liked that the test summed up all the experiments and information at the end, when I was writing the paragraph.

In this way, they help to reduce the COb\u0002\u0002 in the air.\",,\"COb\u0002\u0002 is absorbed by plants and converted into glucose, which then forms cellulose and starch.
